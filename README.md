### Hi there! âœ¨

I'm agnosticlines, you probably know me elsewhere. I'm not a bot, I star a lot of things and follow a lot of people but I am a human.

I have an interest in:
 * reverse engineering
 * os, hypervisor & browser internals
 * program analysis
 * program synthesis
 * fuzzing
 * symbolic execution
 * decompiler research
 * secure software development
 * memory safe languages (rust, zig, go)
 * vulnerability research (mobile & desktop)
 * system emulation
 * red team tooling/implant development
 * backend development
 * frontend development (still learning!)
 * devops
 * self hosted software

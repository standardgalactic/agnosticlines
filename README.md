### Hi there! âœ¨

I'm agnosticlines, you probably know me elsewhere. I'm not a bot, I star a lot of things and follow a lot of people but I am a human.

I have an interest in:
 * reverse engineering
 * program analysis
 * secure software development
 * vulnerability research
 * hypervisor development/system emulation
 * backend development
 * network/system administration
 * self hosted software

#### Contact
I can be reached at `github[.]2cta7 AT simplelogin[.]co`, this is an email forwarder but it points to my main email
